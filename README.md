# C-PROJECT
Carbon Footprint Calculator
Objective: Calculate a user's carbon footprint based on activities like transport, energy use, and waste.
Features: Input different activity data (e.g., vehicle type, distance traveled); display total carbon output, add new activity , remove activity.
Add Activity: Add a new activity with details like type, value, and emission factor.
Remove Activity: Specify the index of an activity to delete it from the list.
View Activities: View all activities entered so far.
Display Report: Show the emissions for each activity and the total emissions.
Exit: Quit the program.

1. Calculate Average Emissions Per Activity:
Add a feature to calculate and display the average emissions per activity. This will help users understand the overall impact of each activity type.
For example, if the user has 3 activities with total emissions of 75 kg CO₂, the program can calculate the average as 
75
÷
3
=
25
 
kg CO₂ per activity
75÷3=25kg CO₂ per activity.
2. Reset All Activities:
Allow users to reset the activity list, clearing all entered data. This can be useful if they want to start over without restarting the program.
Implementing this feature would involve simply resetting the array or list of activities to an empty state.

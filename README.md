Carbon Footprint Calculator

Overview

The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users estimate their carbon emissions based on daily activities. The calculator provides insights into the environmental impact of transportation, energy usage, and waste management, empowering users to make informed decisions to reduce their carbon footprint.

Features

Add Activity: Input details such as activity type, value (e.g., distance, energy consumed), and emission factor.
Remove Activity: Easily delete specific activities from the list.
View Activities: Display all entered activities with details like type, value, and emission factor.
Calculate Average Emissions: Analyze the average emissions per activity to understand the overall impact.
Reset Activities: Clear all entered data to start fresh without restarting the program.
Generate Report: View a detailed summary of emissions for each activity and the total carbon output.
How It Works
User Input: Enter details about activities such as vehicle type, distance traveled, or energy consumed.
Calculation: The program uses predefined emission factors to calculate the carbon output for each activity.
Report Generation: Users can view individual and total emissions in an easy-to-read report.

Example Workflow

1-Add Activities:
Car Travel: 100.00 km with an emission factor of 0.20 → 20.00 kg CO₂
Electricity Usage: 50.00 kWh with an emission factor of 0.50 → 25.00 kg CO₂

2-View Activities:

1. Car Travel - Value: 100.00, Emission Factor: 0.20
2. Electricity Usage - Value: 50.00, Emission Factor: 0.50

3-Remove an Activity:

Choose activity #1 to remove Car Travel.

4-Generate Report:
Carbon Footprint Report:
----------------------------
Electricity Usage: 25.00 kg CO₂
----------------------------
Total Emissions: 25.00 kg CO₂

5-Calculate Average Emissions:
Total Emissions: 75.00 kg CO₂, Activities: 3 → Average: 25.00 kg CO₂ per activity.

6-Reset Activities:
Clear all data and start fresh.
